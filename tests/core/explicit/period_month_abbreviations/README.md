# Period Month Abbreviation Tests

These tests verify recognition of abbreviated month names with trailing periods, which is standard American newspaper/AP style. All format variations are tested across all abbreviated months (Jan., Feb., Mar., Apr., Jun., Jul., Aug., Sep., Oct., Nov., Dec.). Support for period-suffixed month abbreviations was introduced in [Issue #60](https://github.com/craigtrim/fast-parse-time/issues/60). Tests cover standard and ordinal day formats, with and without commas, various sentence positions, case variations, and negative cases for incomplete or invalid dates.

# Explicit Date Tests

These tests cover extraction of calendar dates written in full or partial text form: written month names (full and abbreviated), numeric delimited formats (slash, dot, dash), ordinal variants, short year formats, and boundary dates. They verify correct classification of date types, case-insensitive matching, and behavior when dates appear inside sentence context.

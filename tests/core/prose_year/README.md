# Prose Year Tests

These tests verify extraction of bare year references embedded in prose, such as "in 2004", "since 2019", "circa 2004", and "prior to 2010". This pattern was identified as a gap in [Issue #24](https://github.com/craigtrim/fast-parse-time/issues/24). Tests cover all supported prepositions and multi-word lead phrases, boundary year values, negative cases, and sentence-level context.

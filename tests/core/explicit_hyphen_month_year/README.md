# Hyphen Month-Year Tests

These tests verify extraction of hyphen-delimited month-year patterns such as "Oct-23", "Oct-2023", and the reversed "2023-Oct". This format was identified as unsupported in [Issue #21](https://github.com/craigtrim/fast-parse-time/issues/21). Tests cover abbreviated and full month names, two and four-digit years, forward and reversed orderings, case sensitivity, and sentence-embedded occurrences.

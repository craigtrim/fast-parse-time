# Core Tests

This package contains the primary behavioral and regression tests for the library. Each subdirectory targets a specific pattern family: explicit calendar dates, relative time expressions, temporal keywords, informal quantifiers, and date ranges. These tests define the expected behavior of the library and serve as the authoritative regression baseline across all supported pattern types.

# End-of-Period Abbreviation Tests

These tests verify recognition of the abbreviations "eod" (end of day), "eom" (end of month), and "eoy" (end of year) in isolation and within sentence context. Support for these forms was introduced in [Issue #17](https://github.com/craigtrim/fast-parse-time/issues/17). Tests cover bare forms, uppercase and mixed-case variants, multiple abbreviations in a single string, and correct classification as future-tense references.

# Decade Tests

These tests verify recognition and resolution of decade-scale time expressions such as "a decade ago", "next decade", and "last 2 decades". Decade support was introduced in [Issue #19](https://github.com/craigtrim/fast-parse-time/issues/19), which identified decade as a missing time unit frame. Tests cover tense, cardinality, capitalization, sentence context, and result shape.

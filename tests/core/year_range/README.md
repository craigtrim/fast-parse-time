# Year Range Tests

These tests verify extraction of year range expressions such as "2014-2015", "from 2004 to 2008", and "between 2010 and 2020". Year range support was introduced in [Issue #40](https://github.com/craigtrim/fast-parse-time/issues/40). Tests cover all three expression forms, hyphen variants (standard, en-dash, em-dash), boundary year enforcement, reversed range rejection, same-year rejection, and sentence-embedded occurrences.

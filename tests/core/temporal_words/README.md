# Temporal Word Tests

These tests verify recognition of named temporal references: "today", "yesterday", "tomorrow", named weekdays ("next Friday", "last Monday"), time-of-day references ("this morning", "tonight"), and near-past/near-future idioms. Named day references were introduced in [Issue #6](https://github.com/craigtrim/fast-parse-time/issues/6), weekday references in [Issue #11](https://github.com/craigtrim/fast-parse-time/issues/11), and forward weekday support in [Issue #12](https://github.com/craigtrim/fast-parse-time/issues/12).

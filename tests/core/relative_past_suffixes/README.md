# Relative Past Suffix Tests

These tests verify past-tense relative time expressions that use trailing suffix phrases: "back", "before now", and "prior". The "before now" pattern was identified as a gap in [Issue #8](https://github.com/craigtrim/fast-parse-time/issues/8). Tests cover all time frames, abbreviated unit forms, case insensitivity, phrase context, cardinality accuracy, and integration with the top-level parse API.

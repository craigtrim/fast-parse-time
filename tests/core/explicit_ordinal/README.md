# Ordinal Date Tests

These tests verify extraction of ordinal-format dates such as "the 12th of December", "19th day of May", and "March 3rd". Ordinal day formats were identified as unsupported in [Issue #22](https://github.com/craigtrim/fast-parse-time/issues/22). Tests cover all ordinal suffixes (st, nd, rd, th), various word orderings, dates with and without a year, and sentence-embedded forms.

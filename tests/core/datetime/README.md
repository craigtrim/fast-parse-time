# Datetime Resolution Tests

These tests verify that parsed time references resolve correctly to concrete `datetime` and `timedelta` values. They cover date range calculation, tense handling in resolution, per-frame accuracy (minutes, hours, days, months, years), and the behavior of `to_datetime` and `to_timedelta` with and without a reference point.
